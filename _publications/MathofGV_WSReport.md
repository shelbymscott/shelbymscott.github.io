In May of 2019, a diverse group of researchers participated in a workshop at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. This workshop was sponsored by the Center for the Dynamics of Social Complexity (DySoC) and the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS). The objectives of this workshop were to (i) review the existing approaches on the mathematics and modeling of gun violence, (ii) identify and prioritize areas in the eld that require further research, (iii) develop cross-disciplinary collaborations to gain new perspectives, and (iv) suggest research and data collection that could assist evidence-based policy recommendations. The focus was on these issues in the U.S.. The purpose of this report is to present some of the responses to the mentioned objectives and to suggest areas of future research. Due to the wide variety of participant backgrounds, the identified future research areas are fairly broad and can be approached in different fields using different methods. Cross-disciplinary collaboration will improve the outcomes of research projects in this area.
