I am a final stage PhD candidate working on completing my dissertation. I plan to graduate in May of 2021 and am therefore currently seeking employment. I am a mathematical modeler by training, but am also well versed in ecology, evolutionary biology, statistics, data analytics, and programming. With my experience and skillset, I will be a valuable asset to any workplace.
