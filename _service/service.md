While academia is definitely about publishing, collaborating, and furthering the field, that cannot be our only focus as academics. There is a major need for academics to engage in outreach and service, not only for the benefit of those we reach, but also for ourselves. Engaging in broader impacts gives more than grant money, it also re-instills the purpose of and passion in our work.

Engaging Knoxville in Ecology and Evolution
======
Engaging Knoxville in Ecology and Evolution (EKEE) is an outreach group composed of graduate students from the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the University of Tennessee. It was founded in 2015 by myself and a number of other graduate students with the primary mission of EKEE is to educate and inspire the Knoxville community to preserve and conserve nature. We do this through teaching lessons to students at all levels, hosting informational booths at the Farmer's Market, and raising money for graduate activities. I served as president from 2018-2019.  

Kids U
======
Kids U provides summer camps for Knoxville youth where they have the opportunity to learn from UT faculty, staff, and graduate students. Since 2017, I have developed the curriculum and instructed (serving as lead instructor since 2018) a course entitled Calculation and Crime: Solving Mysteries with Math. High school students spend a week learning how to solve a crime using quantitative methods, then put their skills to the test on the final day of the camp. Students generally increase their math confidence and abilities, as well as learning more about how crimes are solved. The general lesson plan is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WYqaSy5AXTMGlD43kGnDA2fB_dTEw9mm4m5lHprl4dI/edit?usp=sharing). If you would like more of the course materials, please feel free to e-mail me and I am happy to share!  


Mentoring
======
I serve as a mentor for both the Society of Mathematical Biology and for the UT Mentoring Program for Undergraduates. The goal is to give students the ability to ask questions and receive feedback from older students. As a mentor, I have reviewed application materials, advised on interview techniques, and shared my own experiences in graduate school. I created a packet for incoming graduate students that gives some advice about starting a program. Some of the information is specific to the University of Tennessee, but the advice may be helpful for other students. It is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yf6Ii8Mw8zHcwAQxEiD-3d6dILqukigmutWPgZ7JWdA/edit).
