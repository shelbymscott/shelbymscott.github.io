In order to cut down on the amount of reading visitors to my poster were forced to do, I chose to move a number of details about my work to my academic website, accessible by QR code. Below are sections about each part of my poster. Feel free to explore and, as always, [e-mail](mailto:sscott41@vols.utk.edu) me if you have further questions, or find me around the conference this week!

Motivation
======
Gun violence leads to more than 31,000 deaths and 78,000 nonfatal injuries each year in the United States. Homicide is the leading cause of death among African American males aged 10 - 24, and 2/3 of these deaths involve firearm use. The homicide rate for African Americans in 2010 was 16.3 per 100,000, whereas the overall homicide rate was 4.4 per 100,000. Therefore, apparent disparity exists in rates of homicide for different demographic groups. Gun violence does not only affect the direct victims and perpetrators involved in events, studies have shown that adults exposed to gun violence as children showed an increased likelihood for chronic health conditions compared with those who did not experience such exposures. These chronic health conditions include heart disease, cancer, chronic obstructive lung disease, hepatitis, diabetes, and stroke. Exposure to gun violence also leads to an increase in risky behaviors, especially in youth.

Despite the severity of gun violence, there has been little research published on the topic and also limited amounts of funding provided. Gun violence has a similar mortality rate to that of sepsis, but only receives 0.7% of the funding.It is also the second least researched cause of death, with accidental falls as the cause of death with fewer published papers, relative to mortality rate. This is due in part to the Dickey Amendment, passed in 1996. Three years earlier, Arthur Kellermann and colleagues published a paper that found having a gun in the home is significantly associated with increased risk of homicide occurring in the home. In response, Congress passed an amendment in concert with funding appropriations for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which stated no federal funds could be used to promote or advocate for gun control. Similar language has since been added to the funding appropriations for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Removing funding from these two groups effectively reduced large-scale research on gun violence in the United States, contributing to the lack of relevant publications.
