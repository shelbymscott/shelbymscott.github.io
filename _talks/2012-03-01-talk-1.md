Tuberculosis is a chronic illness caused by myobacterium tuberculosis. Due to the existence of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains and the presence of fast and slow latent states, the dynamics of this disease can be far more complicated than present models take into account. This model uses ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to explore the dynamics of tuberculosis, including MDR and XDR strains with fast and slow latent states. The following model presents the interactions between the wild type, MDR, and XDR strains of tuberculosis, taking into account effective treatment of the disease and the possibility for re-infection. The model population for this model is South Africa from 1990-2012, not taking into account race, age, living conditions, or general health. Using this model, we can observe how the TB infection circulates through a population and how treatment must be addressed in order to eradicate this disease when certain parameters are in place.
