In order to cut down on the amount of reading visitors to my poster were forced to do, I chose to move a number of details about my work to my academic website, accessible by QR code. Below are sections about each part of my poster. Feel free to explore and, as always, [e-mail](mailto:sscott41@vols.utk.edu) me if you have further questions, or find me around the conference this week!
