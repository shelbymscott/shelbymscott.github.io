In the early 1990s, the island of Santa Cruz off  the coast of California experienced a rapid decline of the canid Urocyon littoralis santacruzae, also known as the Santa Cruz island fox. The reasons behind this decline could have included disease, predation, competition with other species, and genetic bottlenecking. We present an agent-based model that simulates the population of Santa Cruz island foxes in the absence of disease, predation, and competition. Through our model we provide evidence of an Allee effect in the Santa Cruz island fox population which is exacerbated by genetic selection for reduced reproductive success.
