It turns out that graduate students are not always confined to their offices, writing late into the night until carpal tunnel forces them to eat a meal and sleep for a few hours. Work-life balance is something that all academics tend to struggle with, but is incredibly important for productivity (and overall quality of life). I have a working theory that academics tend to choose hobbies that are long-term. As a subpopulation that is comfortable spending 4-7+ years on one degree, we are also comfortable spending five months working on one knitting pattern or committing to a long form board game. The long term hobby I chose to pursue is long distance running, because running 30+ miles takes less time than debugging code. On top of this, I also rock climb, cook, and love to travel.

Running

Shockingly I was still smiling after the Dirty 20 50K in Golden, CO, in June 2019.

Climbing
======
If you take climbing pictures from the right angle, no one has to know you're only ten feet off the ground.
