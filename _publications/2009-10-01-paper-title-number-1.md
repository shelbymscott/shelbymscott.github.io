In the early 1990s, the island of Santa Cruz o the coast of California experienced
a rapid decline of the canid Urocyon littoralis santacruzae. The reasons behind
this decline included disease, predation, competition with other species, and
genetic bottlenecking. We present an individual-based model that simulates the
population of Santa Cruz island foxes. Through our model we provide evidence
of the Allee Effect in the Santa Cruz island fox population which is exacerbated
by selection for reduced reproductive probability.
