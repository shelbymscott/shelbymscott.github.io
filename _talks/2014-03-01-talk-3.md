Since the publication of the National Research Councils Report BIO2010, efforts have increased to better integrate mathematics and biology in under- graduate education. Unfortunately, equivalent efforts to introduce these quantitative topics at the secondary level have been seldom. Undergraduate courses regularly use technology to integrate these two disciplines, and we believe that technology can similarly be used at the secondary level to prevent quantitative achievement mismatch in undergraduate biology programmes. In this presentation, we discuss existing resources for teaching at both levels using technology and the author's experiences as both student and teacher in courses employing these resources.
