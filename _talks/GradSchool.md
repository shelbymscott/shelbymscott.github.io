[Recording from past iteration of this talk available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p2RvUuvIXHOXOn3_wCNSNmfnBLDEYaR6/view?usp=sharing). My presentation starts around 2:01:00.

Graduate school is a confusing and difficult experience for all students, but there are particular challenges that come from being an interdisciplinary early career researcher. In this talk, I will share some of my struggles faced as a biomathematician/ecologist/statistician/data scientist and give insight to some of the positive and negative feelings many of us seem to have during our time as interdisciplinary graduate students. The goal is to open up an honest conversation about the difficulties of wearing multiple hats as an academic and to de-stigmatize some of these experiences.
